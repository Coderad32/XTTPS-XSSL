# XTTP-XSSL Suite

This suite provides a secure protocol implementation with custom certificate handling, cryptographic primitives, and debugging tools.



## This suite includes:

- **XTTPS Runtime**: Manages secure sessions with custom headers and encrypted payloads
- **XSSL Certification**: Issues and verifies decentralized certificates with pluggable authority logic
- **Security Primitives**: Implements hashing, signing, and encryption algorithms
- **Tooling & Docs**: Includes test runners, packet inspectors, and onboarding guides

## 🔧 XTTPS Runtime

The **XTTPS Runtime** is the engine that drives secure communication sessions. It handles:

- **Session Lifecycle**: Initiates, maintains, and terminates encrypted sessions using custom handshake logic.
- **Header Management**: Parses and validates XTTP headers, supporting custom fields like `X-Session-Token`, `X-Cert-Hash`, and `X-Nonce`.
- **Payload Encryption**: Encrypts/decrypts payloads using primitives like AES-GCM or ChaCha20, optionally supporting layered encryption (e.g., onion-style).
- **Stateful Context**: Maintains session state, including tokens, timestamps, and peer metadata.
- **Extensibility Hooks**: Allows injection of middleware for logging, rate-limiting, or protocol upgrades.

🛠️ *Suggested Modules*:
- `xttps_core.py`: Session orchestration and packet routing
- `xttp_headers.py`: Header schema, validation, and formatting
- `session_store.py`: In-memory or persistent session tracking

## 🏛️ XSSL Certification

The **XSSL Certification Framework** replaces centralized authorities with decentralized or pluggable trust models:

- **Certificate Issuance**: Generates XSSL certificates with fields like identity hash, public key, expiry, and optional metadata.
- **Verification Logic**: Validates certificate chains using trust anchors, revocation checks, and signature verification.
- **Decentralized Authority**: Supports models like Web of Trust, blockchain anchoring, or quorum-based endorsement.
- **Schema Definition**: Certificates follow a JSON schema for interoperability and validation.

🛠️ *Suggested Modules*:
- `issuer.py`: Certificate generation and signing
- `verifier.py`: Chain validation and trust logic
- `schema.json`: Certificate format and constraints

## 🔐 Security Primitives

This layer provides the cryptographic backbone for both transport and certification:

- **Hashing**: SHA-3, Blake3, and optionally custom domain-separated hashes
- **Signing**: ECDSA, Ed25519, and post-quantum options (e.g., Dilithium)
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and hybrid schemes (e.g., ECIES)
- **Benchmarking**: Performance and reliability tests across platforms and payload sizes

🛠️ *Suggested Modules*:
- `primitives.py`: Core cryptographic functions
- `tests/`: Unit tests and benchmarks
- `utils.py`: Key generation, encoding, and padding helpers

## 🧪 Tooling & Docs

Developer experience is key—this layer ensures visibility, testability, and onboarding:

- **Test Runner**: CLI tool to execute protocol tests, validate headers, and simulate sessions
- **Packet Inspector**: Visualizes XTTP packets, headers, and payloads with debug mode and hex dumps
- **Integration Guides**: Step-by-step docs for runtime setup, certificate handling, and protocol flows
- **Examples**: Sample configs, test packets, and annotated flows for quick prototyping

🛠️ *Suggested Modules*:
- `test_runner.py`: CLI test suite
- `packet_inspector.py`: XTTP packet visualization
- `docs/`: Markdown guides and specs
- `examples/`: Sample flows and configs
